# meta-secureos A Yocto Meta-Layer for a Secure Raspberry Pi 4 OS

This Yocto meta-layer is dedicated to building a hardened and secure operating system for the Raspberry Pi 4, leveraging kernel hardening techniques, SELinux enforcement, and the power of the KAS build system. 

## Core Features

*   **Kernel Hardening:** Incorporates kernel-level security enhancements to mitigate vulnerabilities and protect against exploits
*   **SELinux:** Implements SELinux mandatory access control to confine processes and limit their potential impact.
*   **Custom Recipes:** Includes tailored recipes for additional security measures and configurations specific to the Raspberry Pi 4
*   **KAS Build System:** Utilizes the KAS build system for granular control and reproducibility in image construction

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**
    *   Install kas build tool from PyPi (sudo pip3 install kas)

2.  **KAS Project Setup**
    *   Create a KAS project and configure it to include:
        *   `meta-secure-rpi4`
        *   `meta-raspberrypi`
        *   `meta-security`
        *   Any other required layers

3.  **Configuration**
    *   Customize the KAS configuration to enable:
        *   Kernel hardening features
        *   SELinux policy enforcement
        *   Desired packages and configurations
        *   Other security-related settings

4.  **Build**
    *   Execute the KAS build process to generate the secure Raspberry Pi 4 image.
    ``` kas build kas-poky-rpi.yml ```
5. **Flash to system**
    * Use bmaptool to copy the generated .wic.bz2 file to the SD card
